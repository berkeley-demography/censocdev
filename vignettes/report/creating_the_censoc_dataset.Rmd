# Abstract

|         The CenSoc Project links the full-count 1930 and 1940 US Censuses to mortality records obtained from the Social Security Administration. The project uses two different sources of mortality data. The first is the Social Security Death Master (SSDM) File. The second is the Numident (SS-5) files. The report will first explore the completeness of death coverage for both sources and then assess the accuracy and completeness of matched datsets.

## Completeness Death Coverage of Social Security Death Master File

The Social Security Death Master (SSDM) File is a record of all deaths reported to the Social Security Administration since 1937. A total of 85,822,194 deaths are reported in the SSDM. The SSDM contains each deceased individual's first name, last name, middle initial, social security number, date of birth, and date of death. 

Death coverage of the SSDM varies signficantly by year. Coverage of the SSDM was assessed by comparing count of deaths in the SSDM to the Human Mortality Database. Figure 2 shows the annual count of deaths in the SSDM and the HMD.  Coverage is most complete 1975 and 2005.

Further disaggregation by age at death. Below is a lexis surface can be used to assess death coverage. Each cell represents the ratio of death represents that ratio of deaths in the SSDM to deaths in the HMD for a given combination of age and year.

## Completeness Death Coverage of Numident (SS-5) Files

The Numident file is an electronic file maintained by the Social Security Administration containing one record for each Social Security number (SSN) assigned. The Numident files contain three seperate types of entries: applications (SS-5), claim, and death records. There are 72,182,729 SS-5 entries and 49,459,293 death records. Each records can contain multiple Each record can contain multiple iterations. If a new Social Security application is submitted, the new information collected is never overlaid on previous information, but rather stored as a new iteration. The two most common reasons for submitting a new application (resulting in a new iteration) are a lost Social Security card or a change in name, sex, or date of birth [@puckett_story_2009]. Each SS-5 iteration contains first name, middle initial, last name, date of birth, birthplace, sex, race, parent's first and last name, and Social Security number. 

Figure 4 shows the distributions of number of iterations per social security number. As over 17 million individuals had 2 or more iterations, decisions were made for the best way to select the "best" information from these records.

- First Name: maximum number of characters (e.g. "William" over "Bill")
- Last Name: earliest post-1940 last name
- Middle Name: earliest post-1940 middle name
- Birth Place: recency
- Date of Birth: recency 
- Race: recency
- Sex: recency

A total of 40,870,457 individuals in the SS-5 had at least one application. When the individuals were matched by Social Security number onto the 49,459,293 death records in the Numident, a death record was found for 35,174,684 matches. Individuals may be included in the records if they have a 1) verified death or 2) were born before Dec 31, 1907. This explains why some individuals in the Numident have applications without a matching death records. 

Within the Numident, matching an individual's death record to their application record in necessary for linkage because father's last name (key in linking married women) is only available in the application record. Therefore, all coverage shown below is for individuals with a death record and a matching application record.

As shown in figure 6, death coverage in the Numident File is not as complete as death coverage in the SS-5 file.
