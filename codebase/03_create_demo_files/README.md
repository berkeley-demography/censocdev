## Create Demo Files 

This directory contains a script to create demo files for the CenSoc-DMF and CenSoc-Numident. These demo files match the CenSoc files onto the 1\% IPUMS Full-Count Census file. 

Steps to make CenSoc Demo File:

1. Read in IPUMS 1940 1% Extract, CenSoc files, and HISITD to SERIAL/PERNUM crosswalk (IPUMS 1\% sample does not contain HISTID identifier)
2. Link 1940 1\% extract to HISTID crosswalk
3. Link to CenSoc-DMF and CenSoc-Numident
