## Track CenSoc Users 


**Note: As of May 31st, 2023, CenSoc data are now downloadable through Harvard Dataverse rather than our bespoke website. This code should only be used to track users and downloads prior to May 31st, 2023.**


**Summary:** The code in this notebook generates reports and figures about the total number of new CenSoc users. 

Specifically, this code accesses the log of all people who have signed up to download CenSoc data. We report the number of unique people who have ever signed up to download Censoc data as our number of users. The code also links each user to the specific data files they downloaded using the Apache web logs.
