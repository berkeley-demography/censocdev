## Track CenSoc Users 


**Summary:** The code in this notebook generates reports and figures about the total number of new CenSoc users. 

Specifically, this code accesses the log of all people who have signed up to download CenSoc data. We report the number of unique people who have ever signed up to download Censoc data as our number of users. The code also links each user to the specific data files they downloaded using the Apache web logs.
