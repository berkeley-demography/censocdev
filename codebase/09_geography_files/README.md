## Geography Files


**Summary:** The code in directory generates the BUNMD and CenSoc-Numident supplemental geography files. We use raw data on ZIP code at death and city of birth to infer birth city, death state, death county, and more. The BUNMD supplemental geography file can be merged to the BUNMD using SSN. The CenSoc-Numident supplemental geography file can be merged onto the CenSoc-Numident with HISTID.

August 2023: the BUNMD supplemental geography is compatible with BUNMD 2.0. The CenSoc-Numident supplemental geography file is compatible with CenSoc-Numident 2.1 (conservative links only) and CenSoc 3.0.
